## About The Project

- Read the [docs](https://ipfs.github.io/helia/modules/helia.html)
- Look into other [examples](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-examples) to learn how to spawn a Helia node in Node.js and in the Browser
- Visit https://dweb-primer.ipfs.io to learn about IPFS and the concepts that underpin it
- Head over to https://proto.school to take interactive tutorials that cover core IPFS APIs
- Check out https://docs.ipfs.io for tips, how-tos and more
- See https://blog.ipfs.io for news and more
- Need help? Please ask 'How do I?' questions on https://discuss.ipfs.io

## Getting Started

Feel free to jump directly into the examples, however going through the following sections will help build context and background knowledge.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

### Understanding how libp2p works

- [Circuit Relay](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-circuit-relay) - configuring Circuit Relay connections
- [Connection Encryption](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-connection-encryption) - how to encrypt connection between libp2p nodes
- [Delegated routing](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-delegated-routing) - how to offload network operations and queries onto more capable nodes
- [Discovery mechanisms](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-discovery-mechanisms) - how libp2p discovers other peers on the network
- [Custom protocols](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-custom-protocols) - how to create a custom protocol for your application

### Other examples

- [Chat](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-chat) - a simple chat app
- [Browser Pub/Sub](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-browser-pubsub) - Using Pub/Sub between browsers

### libp2p in browsers

There are a number of ways libp2p can be used in the browser. Here are some examples:

- [webRTC](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-example-webrtc-private-to-private)
- websockets (example pending)
- webtransport (example pending)

There is also [universal connectivity](https://github.com/libp2p/universal-connectivity/tree/main) demo that shows of how many different libp2p implementations can be connected together.
